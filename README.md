# vocal_harassment_dissuader

Telegram client bot (i.e. not a Telegram Bot, but a client application that acts as a regular user) which responds to vocal messages in chats saying a custom sentence.
Made for all the people tired of the thumb illnesses of their friends obliging them to ALWAYS send vocal messages.

Supports whitelisting based on telegram username or contact first name.

Implemented using [Telethon](https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon)
